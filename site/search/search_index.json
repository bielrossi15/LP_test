It is mostly backwards compatible, if you have any issue first check this link . If your problem is not solved then go ahead and report the issue . Usage jQuery.scrollTo's signature is designed to resemble $().animate() . $(element).scrollTo(target[,duration][,settings]); element This must be a scrollable element, to scroll the whole window use $(window) . target This defines the position to where element must be scrolled. The plugin supports all these formats: * A number with a fixed position: 250 * A string with a fixed position with px: \"250px\" * A string with a percentage (of container's size): \"50%\" * A string with a relative step: \"+=50px\" * An object with left and top containining any of the aforementioned: {left:250, top:\"50px\"} * The string \"max\" to scroll to the end. * A string selector that will be relative to the element to scroll: \".section:eq(2)\" * A DOM element, probably a child of the element to scroll: document.getElementById(\"top\") * A jQuery object with a DOM element: $(\"#top\") settings The duration parameter is a shortcut to the setting with the same name. These are the supported settings: * axis : The axes to animate: xy (default), x , y , yx * interrupt : If true will cancel the animation if the user scrolls. Default is false * limit : If true the plugin will not scroll beyond the container's size. Default is true * margin : If true , subtracts the margin and border of the target element. Default is false * offset : Added to the final position, can be a number or an object with left and top * over : Adds a % of the target dimensions: {left:0.5, top:0.5} * queue : If true will scroll one axis and then the other. Default is false * onAfter(target, settings) : A callback triggered when the animation ends (jQuery's complete() ) * onAfterFirst(target, settings) : A callback triggered after the first axis scrolls when queueing You can add any setting supported by $().animate() as well: duration : Duration of the animation, default is 0 which makes it instantaneous easing : Name of an easing equation, you must register the easing function: swing fail() : A callback triggered when the animation is stopped (f.e via interrupt ) step() : A callback triggered for every animated property on every frame progress() : A callback triggered on every frame And more, check jQuery's documentation window shorthand You can use $.scrollTo(...) as a shorthand for $(window).scrollTo(...) . Changing the default settings As with most plugins, the default settings are exposed so they can be changed. $.extend($.scrollTo.defaults, { axis: 'y', duration: 800 }); Stopping the animation jQuery.scrollTo ends up creating ordinary animations which can be stopped by calling $().stop() or $().finish() on the same element you called $().scrollTo() , including the window . Remember you can pass a fail() callback to be called when the animation is stopped. onAfter and requestAnimationFrame jQuery.scrollTo has a onAfter callback for work that runs after the animation finishes. It will be called before the scroll event fires. To combat this you can use requestAnimationFrame to do work on the next tick. It is available in many browsers, but you may want to polyfill for the few it does not support. $.scrollTo(100, { onAfter: function() { requestAnimationFrame(function() { $(\".result\").addClass(\"selected\"); }); } }); Demo Check the demo to see every option in action. Complementary plugins There are two plugins, also created by me that depend on jQuery.scrollTo and aim to simplify certain use cases. jQuery.localScroll This plugin makes it very easy to implement anchor navigation. If you don't want to include another plugin, you can try using something like this minimalistic gist . jQuery.serialScroll This plugin simplifies the creation of scrolling slideshows.

Compat Dropped support for $.scrollTo.window() and $(window)._scrollable() Fix Now works consistently on Chrome 40 Now works correctly on Windows Phone Now works correctly on Android Browsers Now works correctly on iOS Browsers 1.4.14 Misc Internal both() function will handle nulls correctly 1.4.13 Misc Support for CommonJS / NPM added by durango 1.4.12 Fix Fixed selector matching body fails on window scrolling 1.4.11 Misc Reverted changes from 1.4.10 1.4.10 Enhancement Giving the plugin an AMD module id so it can be required (f.e by localScroll) 1.4.9 Enhancement \"offset\" setting can now be a function as well (#60) 1.4.8 Enhancement Added support for AMD 1.4.7 Misc Changed spacing Changed licensing to MIT Repo is compliant with official jquery plugins repository 1.4.6 Fix Fixed first argument of onAfter and onAfterFirst was original target and should be \"parsed\" target 1.4.5 Fix Fixed passing a negative scroll value crashes 1.4.4 Change Re-released as 1.4.4 to avoid issues with bower 1.4.3.1 Fix Fixed $.scrollTo(0) broken on 1.4.3 1.4.3 Enhancement Limit calculations can be disabled by setting the option 'limit' to false. Null target or unmatching selector don't break and fail silently Misc Removed support for the deprecated setting 'speed' Fix Removed $.browser.webkit so the plugin works with jQuery +1.8 1.4.2 Feature The plugin support percentages as target ('50%' or {top:'50%', left:'45%'}) Exposed the max() calculation as $.scrollTo.max Enhancement Renamed $.fn.scrollable to $.fn._scrollable to avoid conflicts with other plugins Fix Fixing max calculations for regular DOM elements 1.4.1 Feature The target can be 'max' to scroll to the end while keeping it elegant. Enhancement Default duration is 0 for jquery +1.3. Means sync animation The plugin works on all major browsers, on compat & quirks modes, including iframes. In addition to window/document, if html or body are received, the plugin will choose the right one. Fix The plugin accepts floating numbers, Thanks Ramin Using jQuery.nodeName where necessary so that this works on xml+xhtml The max() internal function wasn't completely accurate, now it is 98% (except for IE on quirks mode and it's not too noticeable). 1.4 Fix Fixed the problem when scrolling the window to absolute positioned elements on Safari. Fixed the problem on Opera 9.5 when scrolling the window. That it always scrolls to 0. Feature Added the settings object as 2nd argument to the onAfter callback. The 3rd argument of scrollTo can be just a function and it's used as the onAfter. Added full support for iframes (even max scroll calculation). Instead of $.scrollTo, $(window).scrollTo() and $(document).scrollTo() can be used. Added $().scrollable() that returns the real element to scroll, f.e: $(window).scrollable() == ###body|html], works for iframes Enhancement Cleaned the code a bit, specially the comments 1.3.3 Change Changed the licensing from GPL to GPL+MIT. 1.3.2 Enhancement Small improvements to make the code shorter. Change Removed the last argument received by onAfter as it was the same as the 'this' but jqueryfied. 1.3.1 Feature Exposed $.scrollTo.window() to get the element that needs to be animated, to scroll the window. Added option 'over'. Enhancement Made the code as short as possible. Change Changed the arguments received by onAfter 1.3 Enhancement Added semicolon to the start, for safe file concatenation Added a limit check, values below 0 or over the maximum are fixed. Now it should work faster, only one of html or body go through all the processing, instead of both for all browsers. Fix Fixed the behavior for Opera, which seemed to react to both changes on and . The border is also reduced, when 'margin' is set to true. Change The option speed has been renamed to duration. Feature The duration can be specified with a number as 2nd argument, and the rest of the settings as the third ( like $().animate ) Remade the demo 1.2.4 Enhancement The target can be in the form of { top:x, left:y } allowing different position for each axis. Feature The option 'offset' has been added, to scroll behind or past the target. Can be a number(both axes) or { top:x, left:y }. 1.2.3 Feature Exposed the defaults. Enhancement Made the callback functions receive more parameters. 1.2.2 Fix Fixed a bug, I didn't have to add the scrolled amount if it was body or html. 1.2 Change The option 'onafter' is now called 'onAfter'. Feature Two axes can be scrolled together, this is set with the option 'axis'. In case 2 axes are chosen, the scrolling can be queued: one scrolls, and then the other. There's an intermediary event, 'onAfterFirst' called in case the axes are queued, after the first ends. If the option 'margin' is set to true, the plugin will take in account, the margin of the target(no use if target is a value).","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"stylesheets/assets/plugins/jquery-scrollTo/CHANGELOG/#changelog","text":"","title":"Changelog"},{"location":"stylesheets/assets/plugins/jquery-scrollTo/CHANGELOG/#212","text":"","title":"2.1.2"},{"location":"stylesheets/assets/plugins/jquery-scrollTo/CHANGELOG/#fix","text":"Plugin
